        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Whereas HTML strictly handles the structure and content of a 
              webpage, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, 
              and organization.</li>
            <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: 
              inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. </li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, 
              whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
            <li>The display property assigned with the block value assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
            <li>The period preceding a class designates this as a class selector.</li>

          <li>git flow aka:  add, commit, and push your work to your feature branch. 
            Then you will open a pull request (verify base and comparison branches), merge your changes with the main branch, 
            and close the GitHub issue. Checkout to main, pull in remote main.</li>
