# Pre-work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

A basic study guide containing notes on four topics discussed during the pre-work module:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Git
    - JavaScript

This helps me organize my thoughts, lessons, and questions â€“ and it will also be fun to look back on as I grow as a developer.

## Installation

n/a

## Usage

Each section contains notes, either copied from the pre-work modules themselves or personal notes I wrote myself.

By viewing the JavaScript console, you'll be able to see the four pre-work subjects listed out, as well as a randomized suggestion for which of the four topics to study.
